SW: 236 GW: 150 CW: 219\\n\\nI weigh myself weekly and measure myself monthly. I\\'d hit a plateau the last four weeks or so where I was stuck at 222. Felt like kind of a bummer, but knew it\\'s because I haven\\'t been as strict as I should with my diet, and the last week and a half have been crazy with life things, so I haven\\'t been exercising as frequently as I\\'ve gotten used to. When I weighed myself as normal on Monday, I was kind of disappointed to see the scale not budging and figured it was time to buckle down again and really watch my diet. Today was my measure-in day, and I\\'ve felt cruddy in general since Monday because I caught some chest congestion/cold bug over the weekend. I get on the scale...it says 219. Whaaaaat? I take my measurements, which are down slightly from last month, and with an total-body loss of 8 inches from my starting point on 12/23/14!

How have you dealt with them, particularly the ones that you can\\'t hide?\\n\\nI\\'m not currently in a relationship, but recently I\\'ve realized that there is someone who likes me, and I\\'m interested in them, too. Frankly, the only reason I\\'m not asking them out is because I know that I have some insecurities that need to be worked through - particularly in the realm of body image. While I\\'m confident in the rest of my body, I\\'ve had terrible, awful acne both on my arms and breasts since I was very young. It\\'s a special type with no complete cure, but doctors suggested that I keep my skin oiled until it goes away (dryness irritates it). Because of this it\\'s not so much present anymore as large clusters of scars are.\\n\\nWould I warn someone about this upfront before anything sexual? Would I just let it surprise them when the clothes come off? Do I tell them \"Let\\'s keep on my shirt for now\" while we do our business? \\n\\nHave you had experiences with anything similar?

One private loan at 9.5% (highest priority obviously) and nine others federal between 3.4% and 6.8%. Minimum payment per month total is $301.16. Over the next 9 months, I will pay off $11k of these, which will get rid of everything above 5% interest and will drop the total minimum payment to $150. \\n\\nAt the end of the 9 months, our savings will be around $35k. At that time my husband will need to purchase a car so some of that will be his down payment. So more realistically $25-30k. \\n\\nSometime in the future, between a year to two years from now, my husband and I may be moving. Typical single family homes in this area go for around $300k. \\n\\nAt the end of the 9 months, should I continue to focus on paying down student debt (which will be a balance of $14k by then) or growing our savings/down payment?

As soon as I start doing her favors, she picks fights and complains nonstop. Latest issue was I offered to take her and her mom to dinner.
